# Quick Sort and Merge Sort

Quick sort and merge sort are two very fascinating sorting algorithms. They both implement a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array.

However, quick sort uses a lot more operations than merge sort. We can see that in the graph below:

The code for this graph is also in this repository. The visuals were made using JavaFX and the quick sort and merge sort code can be found in the `Sort.java` file.
